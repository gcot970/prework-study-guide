# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

While working through the prework course I needed a solution to help me study. This was created to help organize each topic, provide lists and examples to the user, and help me familiarize myself in development environments. This solves the issue of needing to go through many modules to find a certain definition, term, or command that I would often use. With this, I have learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are organized and created. I have also learned how to export these newly created files to GitHub via Git.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

This has topics, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git seperated into their own sections. This allows for neatly organized notes for these topics. It not only has definitions and notes, but for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there is an example in use. To view JavaScript's example, one would have to open DevChrome's console.
